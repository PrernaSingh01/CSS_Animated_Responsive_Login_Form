# CSS_Animated_Responsive_Login_Form

Day 12 of #100DaysOfCode: Today, I dived into creating a stunning CSS animated responsive login page! ðŸš€ðŸ’»âœ¨

It was an exciting challenge that allowed me to explore CSS animations and build a user-friendly login experience. The page adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and engaging user interaction.

I'm thrilled with the progress I'm making in my coding journey, and each day brings new opportunities to learn and grow.

Looking forward to more exciting projects ahead! Stay tuned! ðŸ˜‰
